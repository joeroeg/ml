# Iris Dataset Classification Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple classification task using the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset that contains samples of iris flowers and their corresponding species. In this project, we use machine learning algorithms from Scikit-learn to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Dataset Description
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, with each sample containing four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of iris flower, which can take one of three values: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn
```

## Usage
To train and evaluate the classification models, simply run the `iris_classification.py` script:

```bash
python iris_classification.py
```

This script will load the Iris dataset, preprocess the data, train several classification models, evaluate their performance using cross-validation, and display the results.

## Files
- `iris_classification.py`: Python script for loading the Iris dataset, training classification models, and evaluating their performance.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the project.
- `LICENSE`: License information for the project.
- `requirements.txt`: List of dependencies required to run the project.

## Results
After running the `iris_classification.py` script, you will see the performance metrics of various classification algorithms, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Here's a sample output:

```
Random Forest Classifier:
Accuracy: 0.97
Precision: 0.97
Recall: 0.97
F1-score: 0.97
```
