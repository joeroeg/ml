# Iris Dataset Classification Project

## Overview
This project demonstrates a simple classification task using the famous Iris dataset. The Iris dataset is a multivariate dataset that contains samples of iris flowers and their corresponding species. In this project, we use machine learning algorithms from Scikit-learn to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica.

## Dataset Description
The Iris dataset consists of 150 samples, with each sample containing four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the species of iris flower, which can take one of three values: Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica.

## Installation
To run this project, you need Python installed on your system. You can install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy scikit-learn
